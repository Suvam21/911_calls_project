<h1><b> 911 Calls Project </h1></b>  

My this project performs EDA on a 911 calls dataset imported from Kaggle. I have used different packages to make beautiful plots and heatmap to visualize data and analyze them too.  
<h4>I hope this project helps you understand the concepts. Tools used:  
  1. Pandas  
  2. Seaborn  
  3. Matplotlib  
</h4>
